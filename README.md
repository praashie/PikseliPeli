The one and original.

Because of keyboard ghosting, most non-turn-based local multiplayer games generally have a very limited number of simultaneous players.
Even if using dedicated gaming controllers, the maximum is typically four.
This game attempts to circumvent excessive keyboard ghosting by letting each player control their character with one key.
This way, a generic laptop keyboard could easily support at least 6 players at once, sometimes even more.
